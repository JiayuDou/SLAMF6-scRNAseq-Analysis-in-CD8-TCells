**Single-cell RNA-seq analysis code** for the paper:  
**"SLAMF6 as a drug-targetable suppressor of T cell immunity against cancer"**

This repository contains all code used for the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in the paper.

## Data availability
The single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets analysed in this study are publicly available from the original publication:  
Zheng, L. et al. Pan-cancer T cell atlas links a cellular stress response state to immunotherapy resistance. *Nat. Med.* **29**, 1550–1562 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02371-y  

Processed CD8 T-cell data were downloaded from the MD Anderson Single-Cell Research Portal (SCRP;https://singlecell.mdanderson.org/TCM/)

No new primary sequencing data were generated in this study.
